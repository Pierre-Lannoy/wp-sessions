You can limit concurrent sessions, on a per role basis for the following criteria:

* count per user;
* count per IP adresses;
* count per country (requires the free [IP Locator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ip-locator/) plugin);
* count per device classes and types, client types, browser or OS (requires the free [Device Detector](https://wordpress.org/plugins/device-detector/) plugin).

For each roles defined on your site, you can also block login based on private/public IP ranges, and define idle times for sessions auto-termination.

__Sessions__ can report the following main items and metrics:

* KPIs: login success, active sessions, cleaned sessions, active users, turnover and spam sessions;
* active and cleaned sessions details;
* users and sessions variations;
* moves distribution;
* login/logout breakdowns;
* password resets;
