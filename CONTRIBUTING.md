# Contributing to Device Detector

Hello and welcome in this short guide which aims to help you figure out how you can be helpful. I'm very excited to know you want to share your knowledge and your skills to make Device Detector a better plugin. Thank you so much for your involvement and engagement!

Note: to make this repository a safe place to contribute, Device Detector has a [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Submitting bugs, making suggestions, proposing new features
If you'd like to do it, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/sessions/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/sessions/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or found the same bug.

If you know how to fix the bug or implement your new feature, please open an issue first to discuss it before submitting a pull request - unless it is a small fix (in which case you can do so directly).

## Translating Device Detector in your language

To start to translate the Device Detector interface in your language, jump to the [official GlotPress section for Device Detector](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/sessions/) and pick the line for your language…

To find ressources on translations, handbooks, guidelines, etc. your starting point is [The Polyglots Blog](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/). This blog is the central point of the translators community, either for the core of wordpress, the plugins or the themes.
There are many interesting things on this blog that I let you discover, but the main documents – the ones I encourage you to read before you start – are:
- [The General Expectations](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/expectations/), the do’s and don’ts.
- [The Glossaries and Style Guides](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/list-of-glossaries-per-locale/), per locale.

You can get help from the community of translators of your own language, usually on the ___#polyglots___ channel of [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/), or directly from me (___@pierrelannoy___ on Slack).
